    "title":"DiversiPhi29: an orthogonal system for the continuous directed evolution of genes in vivo",
    "abstract":"Continuous directed evolution techniques leverage error-prone replication machinery for rapid in vivo mutagenesis of target genes. However, promiscuous activity by error-prone machinery can lead to damage of the host genome.nHere, we propose an orthogonal replication system, DiversiPhi29, for the continuous directed evolution of genes in vivo in a bacterial chassis. This system leverages the well-studied bacteriophage u03a629 and E. coli. In this project, we first attempt to modify four u03a629 proteins to enable the heterologous replication of a linear construct consisting of a single gene-of-interest and origin sequences. Once orthogonal replication is established, we will implement a system capable of tuning the mutation rate of the linear constructu2019s replication by altering the ratio of two u03a629 DNA polymerases, one of which contains fidelity-reducing mutations. This approach will enable high throughput molecular evolution in the best understood model organism.",
